## About Me

I am Chengrui (RyanðŸ¦„.eth) Fang. I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in Information Security in <a href="http://www.cs.zju.edu.cn/turingclass_en/main.htm" target="black">Turing Class</a>, first honors class at <a href="http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/" target="black">Chu Kochen Honors College</a>, and I am currently ranked first in my major. I minor in the <a href="http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/2022/0225/c44633a2500643/page.htm" target="_blank">Intensive Training Honors Program of Innovation and Entrepreneurship</a>, the best minor program at Chu Kochen Honors College, Zhejiang University.
During my undergraduate studies, I am grateful to be advised by <a href="https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/bingsheng" target="black">Prof. Bingsheng Zhang</a>. I also had a pleasant summer at Yale University in 2023, under the guidance of <a href="https://www.fanzhang.me/" target="balck">Prof. Fan Zhang</a>.

Under the mentorship of Prof.  -->

I'm a <a target="black">hacker, creator, and entrepreneur</a>, inspired by "<a href="http://paulgraham.com/hp.html" target="black">Hackers and Painters</a>" by <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/" target="black">Y Combinator</a> founder <a href="http://paulgraham.com/" target="black">Paul Graham</a>. Hacking, or developing, is the act of creating something new, much like painting. This analogy eventually became my guiding principle. My computer is like my paintbrush, I use it to "paint" my products, blogs and videos. Hacking is a way for me to <a target="black">express myself, connect, and resonate with others</a>, like a stone, causing ripples in the lake.

I am an alumnus of the <a href="https://opencasestudies.github.io/" target="_blank"> Open Case Study Project</a> at <a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/" target="_blank"> the Bloomberg School of Public Health </a> of <a href="https://www.jhu.edu/" target="_blank"> the Johns Hopkins University</a>. -->

I am currently interested in <a target="black">generative AI, blockchain, crypto, and HCI</a>. At the same time, I am also interested in their applications in gaming, education, and social scenarios. I am currently leading a team to explore the future of education, focusing on creating <a target="black">AI-powered gamified PBL (Project-Based Learning) teaching software</a> on the iPad for elementary school students. The software will allow children to use generative AI tools to complete their projects within the game. The idea originated from my first hackathon experience during my sophomore year, which helped me find confidence and passion. Through Project-Based Learning, I continued to grow through practical experience and project work, becoming the best version of myself. In 2023, the rapid development of Gen AI has also been instrumental in my fast growth. Therefore, I hope to integrate PBL and AI. I aim to <a target="black">use next-generation creative tools (AI) to cultivate the creativity of the next generation and nurture the next generation of innovators like Jobs and Musk</a>. I want to use AI to help children bring their ideas to life and create something uniquely their own. This is also a gift to me ten years ago. As a creator, my dream, shaped by my limited education, is to <a target="black">utilize technology to provide high-quality education for underrepresented children, enabling them to grow and become creators</a>, echoing the 'Y Combinator' metaphor in computer science â€” a program that fosters other programs.
